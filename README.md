# react-gulp-es6-skeleton
This is boilerplate for creating node apps with react in ES6.

Includes:
 - gulp watch tasks and browserSync to hot reload during development
 - minifying JS 
 - autoprefixor compilation to include browser prefixes in compiled sass
 - babel config to allow development in ES6
 - bower to manage front end dependencies (although, using npm and browserify this is not as necessary)
 - .gitignore with typical files (`node_modules/`, `.DS_Store`, etc)
